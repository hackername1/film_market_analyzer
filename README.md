# Program
This program is designed to analyze a dataset of movies and sort them by various criteria such as year, genre, and budget. It outputs detailed statistics about the analysis, including the average film budget, revenue, and success rate. The program is capable of analyzing a dataset of movies based on various criteria such as year, genre, and budget. This allows users to easily sort and understand the data, and make informed decisions about the movie industry.

# Set up

# Important
The current version of the program is working as intended and is able to analyze a dataset of movies based on various criteria. However, please note that this program is not final and may undergo significant changes in the future. We are always looking for ways to improve the program and may make changes in the future to extend its functionality.

# Current result
The program has generated an [output file](output.pdf) which is now available for review in the repository. This file contains the results of the analysis.
